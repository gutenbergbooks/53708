<h2>Tacoma and Vicinity.</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Tacoma has well been called the “City of
Destiny,” for never in the history of our
great republic has the finger of destiny so
unerringly pointed to the location of a large commercial
and manufacturing metropolis as it did to
the shores of Commencement bay when the Northern
Pacific located here the terminus of its main
line on Puget sound. In its history, years have
witnessed more life and growth, more progress in
business and wealth and the creation of more permanent
values of property, than decades in the
history of older and admittedly prosperous cities
of the eastern states. Eight years ago, at the beginning
of the present decade, Tacoma had a population
of but seven hundred and twenty souls, its
streets were ungraded and full of stumps, and its
business blocks were few and of but the cheapest
of frame structures. What mighty things have
been wrought in the brief time which has since
elapsed! Now it has many miles of graded streets,
of water and gas mains, of telegraph, telephone
and electric light wires and street railways, solid
blocks of brick and stone business structures, large
and commodious opera house, public schools, seminaries
and academies, elegant hotels, large factories,
great and expanding docks, warehouses and
shipping facilities, a taxable property of $6,555,400
and a population of twenty thousand souls. It is
this Tacoma of to-day, bustling, vigorous, full of
life and business, and advancing with prodigious
strides, which is treated of in the following pages
of engravings and descriptive matter. These engravings,
elegant and artistic as they are, fall far
short of doing justice to a city whose prosperity,
vitality and progressiveness it is impossible to convey
to paper. They are the Tacoma of to-day, but
will be almost as unlike the great city ten years
from now which will bear that name, as they are
unlike that city of board shanties which occupied
this site eight years ago.</p>

<h2>TACOMA’S NEW GRAND OPERA HOUSE.</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="75" height="120" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Tacoma has hitherto lacked one most essential
feature of a city&mdash;an opera house&mdash;and
for this reason has been often denied the
pleasure of listening to some of the great dramatic
stars who have visited the coast. It will not be
long before this will be remedied, as the most elegant
opera house north of San Francisco is now in
course of erection. Several of the public spirited
citizens of this place recently organized the Tacoma
Opera House Company, with a capital stock of
$100,000.00, for the purpose of building an opera
house such as the growing needs of the city require.
Plans were drawn for an elegant building
to cost $75,000.00, and this is now in course of construction
on the corner of Ninth and C streets.
The first story is of stone and the remainder of
brick and terra cotta. It will have accommodations
for several stores on the ground floor, and
for a number of offices up stairs, and will be completed
early in the spring of 1889. In all its appointments
it will be elegant, and will have a seating
capacity of twelve hundred. The stage settings,
dressing rooms, mechanical appliances and
all the accessories of a theater will be of the best
pattern, and the opera chairs of the latest design.
From the engraving of the exterior given on the
opposite page, it will be seen that this structure
will be one of the most imposing and ornamental
architectural features of the city. It is located
convenient to the hotels, the business portion of
the city and the street car lines. With such an
opera house as this, and with a population of twenty
thousand people to give them patronage, the
best attractions in the United States will be drawn
to Tacoma as one of the regular “show towns” of
the grand transcontinental circuit.</p>

<h2>HOTELS OF THE TERMINAL CITY.</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="75" height="120" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Tourists unhesitatingly declare that in this
city they find the only really adequate and
enjoyable hotel accommodations to be had
on the Pacific coast north of San Francisco, and to
this one fact is due much of the popularity of the
city spread abroad by those who have enjoyed its
hospitalities. Recognizing the necessity for such
an institution, the Tacoma Land Company erected
in 1884 the large and handsome stone and brick
hotel building shown in the engraving on the opposite
page. It stands on the bluff above the
water front, overlooking the bay, river, valley, foothills
and mountains. From the veranda and lawn
a grand landscape may be seen, the great snowy
mass of Mount Tacoma standing out in bold relief
against the sky. The possession of such a house
of entertainment, elegantly furnished and conducted
in first class style by Mr. W. D. Tyler, a most
courteous and able manager, renders the city a favorite
summer resort and headquarters for those
who desire to spend a few weeks viewing the grand
scenery of the sound. On another page is given
an engraving of the new and elegant Hotel Fife,
a large five-story brick structure, recently completed
at a cost of $125,000.00. It contains one hundred
and twenty-six rooms, and is supplied with
all the modern conveniences of gas, water, electric
bells, elevator, etc. Hotel Fife is most elegantly
furnished, and is conducted on the European plan.
Hotel Rochester, recently erected on Tacoma avenue
(see engraving on another page), is a large
brick edifice, four stories high, and cost $75,000.00.
It occupies a commanding site, and is designed
for a family hotel, all its rooms being <i>en suite</i>, with
bath, electric light and water. It is heated by
steam, and has its own electric light plant, laundry
and Turkish bath. A number of smaller hotels
add to the city’s accommodations for strangers.</p>

<h2>GRAIN SHIPMENTS AND FLOURING MILLS.</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-l.jpg" width="75" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Less than a year has passed since Tacoma entered
regularly into the shipping of grain
and flour to foreign markets, though practically
this business began the present year, after
the completion of the tunnel through the mountains.
During the year ending June 30, 1888,
there were shipped from this port eight hundred
and thirty-eight thousand two hundred and thirty-three
bushels of grain, and the estimated quantity
for the current fiscal year is four million five hundred
thousand bushels, requiring a grain fleet of
sixty vessels, being an average of one cargo dispatched
every six days. Owing to the fact that
vessels can enter Puget sound more cheaply than
the Columbia river, and can discharge and receive
cargo and get to sea again cheaper, charters are
much lower here than at Portland, and the price
of wheat proportionately higher. For this reason
the wheat along the line of the Northern Pacific,
which, before the completion of the road over the
mountains, was shipped to Portland, now comes to
Tacoma. As the Northern Pacific and its branches
and connecting lines ramify the entire wheat
region east of the Cascades, where twenty million
bushels will be produced this year, it can be seen
that an estimate of four million five hundred thousand
bushels for the present year is not a large
one. Wheat warehouses, with a capacity of five
hundred thousand bushels, have been built on the
water front, and are being doubled in size. The
Northern Pacific Elevator Co. is erecting a four-story
elevator, with a capacity of a million bushels,
and has elevators and warehouses at all the
principal shipping points in the interior. The only
steam flouring mill on Puget sound is located here.
Not only is this port superior to Portland as a general
shipping point for grain and flour, but it has
special advantages in the China trade, which consumes
twenty-five hundred barrels per month of
Pacific coast flour. Recognizing this, gentlemen
engaged largely in manufacturing flour in Oregon
are erecting an immense mill with a daily capacity
of one thousand barrels, which will begin grinding
next season.</p>

<h2>COAL AND IRON RESOURCES.</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-c.jpg" width="75" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Coal shipments from the port of Tacoma average
twenty-seven thousand tons a month,
being the product of mines situated in the
region immediately tributary to the city and along
the line of the Northern Pacific. These mines are
owned and operated by the Carbon Hill Coal Co.,
the Wilkeson Coal and Coke Co., the Tacoma Coal
Co., the South Prairie Coal Co., all in the Puyallup
region, and the Bucoda Coal Co., south of the
city. Nearly all these shipments go by sail and
steamer to the San Francisco market. The Durham
coal mines, sixty miles east of Tacoma, are
just being opened, and provision is being made for
a daily output of three hundred tons. This is fine
coking coal, and will be used by the great iron
smelters to be erected at Cle Elum. The mine is
the property of the Pacific Investment Co. At
Roslyn, on the east side of the mountains, are the
mines of the Northern Pacific Coal Co., whose
headquarters are in this city. Inexhaustible in
quantity, and much of it making the finest quality
of coke, the coal deposits about Tacoma must build
up a very large city here. Iron ore of a superior
quality lies in immense and easily accessible deposits
almost at the city’s gate. Coal, coke and
iron, with limestone in abundance, suggest the
great manufacturing possibilities, to take advantage
of which an immense enterprise is already on
foot, in the form of a gigantic iron smelting plant,
to be erected at Cle Elum, near the Roslyn mines,
by the Moss Bay Iron Co., one of the largest institutions
of its kind in England, and the huge reduction
works soon to be erected at Tacoma by a
company recently organized for that purpose.</p>

<h2>LUMBER INTERESTS OF TACOMA.</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-l.jpg" width="75" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Lumber is one of the chief products of Puget
sound, and in the lumbering industry Tacoma
leads all other cities on the sound, or on
the Pacific coast. Mill capacity has more than
doubled the present season. In January four mills
were cutting four hundred thousand feet per day;
since then five new mills have been built and two
of the old ones have increased their capacity, one
of them, the Tacoma Mill Co., to five hundred
thousand feet, making now a total output of eight
hundred and thirty-five thousand feet. This will
be greatly increased in a short time, as one of the
mills, owned by the St. Paul &amp; Tacoma Lumber
Co., is credited with only fifteen thousand feet, and
is but a temporary concern engaged in sawing timbers
for an immense mill which will be turning
out five hundred thousand feet per day in a few
weeks. Another new mill will cut one hundred
thousand feet, and still another thirty-five thousand,
while the capacity of another will be increased.
Thus, by the spring of 1889, Tacoma will have
eleven mills cutting an aggregate of more than one
and one-half million feet of lumber per day. On
the opposite page is an engraving of the Pacific
Mill, built this year, and one of the most complete
establishments of its kind in the world, with a capacity
of three hundred thousand feet a day. The
larger mills are all supplied with shingle and lath
machines, and millions of lath and cedar shingles
are made daily. The output of shingles has quadrupled
within the past year. Sash and door factories
have increased in number and capacity, their
product finding a market on the sound and along
the line of the Northern Pacific. Lumber is shipped
from the mills direct to California, Chili, Peru,
Central America, Sandwich islands, Australia, Japan
and China, and ship timbers, spars and masts
are sent to Europe and the Atlantic coast of the
United States. Often a dozen ships are in port at
one time loading lumber, and the scene along the
docks is a busy one. By rail, lumber is sent as far
east as Denver and Omaha.</p>

<h2>LOGGING ON PUGET SOUND.</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-p.jpg" width="75" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Puget sound holds a leading position in the
United States in the magnitude of its logging
operations. The quantity of logs put into
the water in 1888 was four hundred and thirty-four
million five hundred thousand feet. Logging is
carried on to the best advantage in the summer
time, and logging railroads, sometimes several
miles in length, upon which locomotives draw cars
of logs from the interior to the sound, or to streams
connecting with it, have been built by a number
of companies at great expense. In the huge size
of the timber, the logger of the west finds an obstacle
to contend with that the logger of the Michigan
pineries does not encounter. Logs of six feet
in diameter are frequent, while they occasionally
much exceed that figure. Ox teams generally consist
of six pairs of lusty animals, which are used
to drag the logs to the railroad or stream. In cutting
down this huge timber, the choppers use a
novel device to avoid cutting through the swell
near the ground. A notch several inches deep is
cut in the side of the tree, and the end of a spring
board, having an iron shoe, is put into the notch
in such a way that it is bound fast by the weight
of the chopper when he stands on it. If the first
notch is not high enough, another is cut higher up.
By this method the stumps left standing are from
six to twelve feet high. When the tree is very
large, two choppers work at a time, as shown in
the engraving on the opposite page.</p>

<h2>GENERAL OFFICES OF THE NORTHERN PACIFIC RAILROAD.</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-a.jpg" width="75" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">At the edge of the bluff overlooking the harbor,
and at the head of the grade leading
down to the water front, stands the elegant,
commodious building used for the general offices
of the Northern Pacific. It is a most substantial
structure of brick and iron, cemented on the exterior
walls, having a basement, three stories and
an attic, with asbestos felt under each floor, and
was completed in the fall of 1888 at a total cost of
$125,000.00. In all, the building contains fifty-three
office and store rooms, and nineteen commodious
fire-proof vaults, one being connected with
every suite of rooms. It is heated by hot water,
and the interior finishing and furnishing is very
elegant and ornamental. In addition to the offices
of the Northern Pacific, the building will be
occupied by the western office of the land department
of the N. P. R. R., managed by Mr. Paul
Schulze, the Tacoma Land Company, Mr. Isaac
W. Anderson, manager, the Northern Pacific Coal
Company, and the Northern Pacific Express Company.
This elegant and imposing structure, occupying
such a commanding site, will always be one
of the most striking architectural features of the
city, proclaiming to the world the confidence the
officers of the Northern Pacific have in the future
of the great city springing up at its western terminus.</p>

<h2>TACOMA’S FINE BUSINESS BLOCKS.</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-n.jpg" width="75" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Not the least of the marvels of Tacoma’s history
is the great business blocks that have
been erected, converting a forest wild into a
city of brick and stone in less than a decade. A
suggestion of the massive appearance of the buildings
on a portion of one of the streets is given by
the first engraving in this volume, while on other
pages are presented engravings of a number of
fine business blocks but recently erected. Here is
located the only chamber of commerce building
north of San Francisco. It is a substantial three-story
stone and brick structure, and in addition to
the board of trade rooms contains commodious offices
and stores. Union block, on the corner of
Eleventh street and Pacific avenue, is a three-story
and basement brick structure, erected by Cogswell
&amp; Son and John S. Baker. It is one hundred by
one hundred and twenty feet in size, contains large
stores and office rooms and cost $55,000. Sprague
Buildings is the title of a large brick block four
stories high, and extending three hundred and
eighteen feet on Pacific avenue, erected by Gen. J.
W. Sprague. It cost $75,000.00, and contains four
stores for wholesale business, each occupying four
floors and basement. Germania hall is a frame
structure sixty-six by one hundred and twenty
feet in size, erected by the Germania Society, on E
street, between thirteenth and fourteenth, at a cost
of $10,000.00. It contains a large hall for amusements
and meetings, with other rooms and basement.
Ouimette block is a handsome three-story
brick structure on Pacific avenue. Mason block
stands on A street, one block from “The Tacoma,”
and is a handsome three-story brick edifice, with
St. Louis pressed brick front and Bellingham bay
blue stone trimmings. It contains the post office,
express office, a store and many elegant office
rooms. The buildings specially mentioned are
only those recently completed. Many other fine
business structures adorn the business thoroughfares
and testify to the prosperity and solid business
interests of the city.</p>

<h2>STREETS, WATER WORKS AND ELECTRIC LIGHTS.</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-e.jpg" width="75" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Electricity lights the business thoroughfares
and many of the stores, while gas illuminates
other portions of the city. The gas
works were built in 1884, and the electric light
plant, now having twenty miles of wire, was put
in by a responsible company in 1887. There is,
also, an excellent telephone service, with an extended
circuit reaching Puyallup valley. In its
water works it is especially fortunate. The system
was built in 1884, at a cost of $300,000.00, and consists
of eleven miles of mains, supplied with pure
water by an aqueduct ten miles in length. The
lower portion of the city is supplied by direct pressure
from the reservoir, two hundred and sixty-two
feet above the harbor, while the upper levels are
served by powerful Holly pumps. A splendidly
equipped fire department gives the city ample protection
from the destroying element. In the matter
of the improvement of its streets the city has
done more to show its progressive and metropolitan
character than in any other way. The leading
thoroughfares are macadamized, and throughout
the entire city streets are graded and in good
condition. There are thirty-five miles of graded

limits. A horse car line runs the entire length of
Pacific avenue from the water front, and a motor
line runs out to Division avenue and Tacoma avenue,
and along the latter both north and south for
a long distance.</p>

<h2>TACOMA AS A MANUFACTURING CITY.</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-w.jpg" width="85" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Whenever so young a city as Tacoma is mentioned
it is generally spoken of as a prospective
metropolis, whose present growth is
based largely upon the future. Great as Tacoma’s
future is sure to be, its present condition has not
been reached by discounting it nor is its great
prosperity due to large drafts on future industries.
It has now many establishments which employ a
large number of hands, pay many thousands of
dollars to workmen monthly, and turn out a manufactured
product valued at millions of dollars annually.
One of these branches of industry is the
saw mills and sash factories spoken of elsewhere,
in which Tacoma is one of the leading cities of the
world. Besides this there are a furniture factory,
iron foundry, machine shops, flouring mills, car
shops, and a number of smaller industries. The
car shops of the Northern Pacific are located here,
and give employment to a large number of hands.
The huge reduction works being erected here, the
flouring mills, and the gigantic iron smelting enterprise
at Cle Elum, have been mentioned on
other pages. The only coking ovens on the coast
are located near the city and are owned by Tacoma
parties. These enterprises are enough to account
for the prosperous condition of the city, yet
they are but an index of the manufacturing which
will be done here in a few years. Situated in the
midst of coal, iron, limestone, and hard and soft
wood timber, all of unlimited quantity and superior
quality; occupying the position of actual and
operating terminus of a great transcontinental railroad,
which renders tributary to it a vast empire
producing cereals, stock, fruit, hops and other agricultural
products in abundance, and is the outlet
for a dozen of the richest mining districts in the
west; and being already the largest shipping port
on the greatest inland harbor on the Pacific coast,
its future as a manufacturing city is assured beyond
all question.</p>

<h2>MOUNT TACOMA, THE CASCADE MONARCH.</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-r.jpg" width="75" height="120" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Rearing its great mass of snow and ice far
above the surrounding mountains, Mt. Tacoma
is the most commanding object in every
Puget sound landscape, and is never seen to
better advantage than from the streets of Tacoma.
Its height is fourteen thousand four hundred and
forty-four feet, exceeding that of any other of the
numerous snow peaks of the Cascades, and in
beauty of form and location it stands pre-eminent
the monarch of the mountains. Captain George
Vancouver, the discoverer and original explorer of
Puget sound, in May, 1792, named this mountain
“Rainier,” in honor of Rear Admiral Rainier, of
the English navy, but the people of Puget sound,
who can see no reason why the original and characteristic
names given such objects by the aborigines
should be changed, have discarded that title
and restored the Indian name “Tacoma.” It is a
beautiful name and most appropriate, meaning
“near to heaven.” Ascents of the mountain are
very frequently made by tourists, arrangements for
which can be made in Tacoma. The view from
its summit is grand beyond description, and the
wild and rugged nature of its glaciers, gorges, canyons
and rocky precipices give the mountain climber
all the excitement he can reasonably desire.
Mountain sheep and goats are hunted amid its
glaciers by the venturesome sportsman, and the
forests of the surrounding mountains are full of
game that will try the nerve and skill of the most
experienced hunter, no matter from what quarter
of the globe he may come.</p>

<h2>REDUCTION OF ORES OF THE NORTHWEST.</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-y.jpg" width="75" height="120" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Yearly the output of ores in the mines of
Oregon, Washington and Northern Idaho is
increasing. Not only are the older mines
enlarging their yield, but new ones are constantly
being developed. New mineral discoveries are
made frequently and the number of mining districts
increases every year. The remarkable mines
being developed in the Cœur d’Alene, Okanagan,
Colville, Pine Creek, Cracker Creek and other districts,
have placed this region in the front rank of
mining interests in the United States, and point to
a future of unbroken prosperity for many years.
At some point so situated as to reach each of these
districts with almost equal facility, and where all
the essentials for the reduction of ores, such as
coal, iron, wood, limestone, etc., exist or can be
cheaply procured, will be established immense reduction
works. Such a point is Tacoma, and a
project is already well advanced to inaugurate this
industry on an extensive scale. A smelting company
has been incorporated with a capital stock of
$1,000,000.00, and ground has been secured on the
water front for the extensive buildings required.
The plant will have a daily capacity of two hundred
tons at first, but this will be enlarged after
the business is well established. President and
chief promoter of this enterprise is Mr. Dennis
Ryan, proprietor of the famous Hotel Ryan, of St.
Paul, and extensively engaged in mining enterprises.
The marvelously rich ores of Alaska will
be drawn upon largely, and will find here their
nearest market. All the indications point to Tacoma
as the head of the mining industry in this
region not only because of its reduction works,
but because of the large investments its capitalists
are making in mining properties.</p>

<h2>PARKS, DRIVES AND AQUATICS.</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-p.jpg" width="75" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Parks are the adjuncts of cities of more mature
years than this young giant of Puget
sound, but nature has provided here that
which many other cities acquire only by the outlay
of much money and labor through a series of
years. Lying south of the city, and but a short
distance beyond its present limits, is a beautiful,
level, gravelly plain, studded with oak trees, in
the midst of which are lakes of clear, sparkling
water. American lake, shown in the engraving
opposite, where it forms the foreground for a beautiful
landscape, of which Mount Tacoma is the
central figure, attracts hundreds of pleasure seekers.
Its waters teem with trout, and its shining
surface offers both the oarsman and the yachtsman
an opportunity to indulge in their favorite
amusement. The drive from the city to the park
is one of keen enjoyment to one whose eye drinks
in the beauties of nature, and who delights to fill
his lungs with the pure air, fragrant with the odor
of forest and mountain. Other drives, in and
about the city, offer the visitor exhilarating pleasure
and beautiful landscapes. Not the least of the
enjoyments of the tourist temporarily sojourning
in the city is the row or sail on the placid waters
of the harbor, or the more exciting sport of trolling
for salmon in the bay. As many as a dozen
fine salmon, from five to fifteen pounds in weight,
are often caught in a few hours in the early morning.
A boat house stands at the water’s edge,
where row and sail boats may be procured, and
morning and evening and on moonlight nights at
a late hour, these little craft dart over the bay
with their loads of pleasure seekers.</p>

<h2>EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND CHURCHES.</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-e.jpg" width="75" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Education in its higher forms was one of the
first thoughts of the intelligent and liberal
men who founded Tacoma, and in this matter
Mr. C. B. Wright, formerly president, and still
a director, of the Northern Pacific railroad, has
taken the lead. The Annie Wright seminary,
named in honor of the daughter of Mr. Wright,
was endowed by him with $50,000.00, and was
erected in 1884 at a cost of $35,000.00, with funds
raised in the east by Rt. Rev. J. A. Paddock, D.D.
It stands at the corner of Tacoma and Division
avenues, on two irregular blocks of ground donated
by the Tacoma Land Company. It is under the
charge of Mrs. L. H. Wells, principal, assisted by
a corps of fifteen instructors, and has an attendance
of one hundred and thirty-five young ladies.
Washington college was also endowed by Mr.
Wright with $50,000.00, and was erected with
funds raised by Bishop Paddock in Tacoma and in
the east. It occupies a commanding site donated
by the Tacoma Land Co., facing eastward upon
Tacoma avenue. It is under the charge of D. S.
Pulford, A.M., head master, assisted by E. P.
Young, A.M., and a complete corps of instructors.
Both of these institutions are Episcopal in their
origin and management. The Methodists have
selected Tacoma as the seat of a university to be
under the auspices of that denomination. Large
and valuable grounds have been donated by citizens,
and buildings to cost $100,000.00 will soon
be erected. These institutions place Tacoma far
in the lead in educational matters in the northwest.
The religious denominations are well represented
in the city by numerous church edifices,
but sufficient time has not yet elapsed for the erection
of many very large or costly churches. A
handsome stone structure is St. Luke’s Memorial
church, erected by Mr. Wright at a cost of $25,000.
Mention should also be made of the Fannie C.
Paddock Memorial hospital, dedicated to the memory
of the wife of Bishop Paddock who did such
good work in founding the other institutions.</p>

<h2>THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF TACOMA.</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-q.jpg" width="75" height="120" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Quite as much praise should be bestowed
upon the citizens of Tacoma for the excellent
public school system they have created
as for the wonders they have achieved in the
construction of a substantial city in so brief a period.
Public schools have been recognized as one
of the fundamental necessities of society throughout
the west generally, and wherever the nucleus
of a city has been planted, the public school system
has formed part of the seed. Especially in
Tacoma is this regard for the educational welfare
of the rising generation exhibited in a marked degree.
Six school buildings have been erected, engravings
of which are given on the opposite page,
and these will soon be inadequate to accommodate
the children applying for admission. In 1880 but
one hundred children attended the single school.
By 1884 this had increased to four hundred, to five
hundred in 1885, and now, in 1888, no less than
fifteen hundred children are enjoying the advantages
of free instruction in the six school buildings.
The schools are thoroughly systematized
and graded from the primary to the high school
department, and are under the charge of a competent
superintendent, ably assisted by a large corps
of teachers. The enterprise, liberality and good
citizenship displayed in thus providing promptly
and adequately for the needs of the ever-increasing
numbers of school children, is an evidence of
the energy and intelligence of the citizens, and explains
much that seems wonderful in the phenomenal
growth of the city.</p>

<h2>RAILROADS OF THE TERMINAL CITY.</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-g.jpg" width="75" height="120" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Great sport was made of Tacoma’s railroad
aspirations a few years ago, but now things
have assumed a different aspect. This city
is now not only the theoretical, but the actual, terminus
of the Northern Pacific railroad. Here are
located the company’s general offices, the offices
of the land department, the western car shops,
and all the docks and terminal facilities owned by
the company on the Pacific coast. The lines of
this road not only extend east to St. Paul, and
thus connect with all the eastern trunk roads, but
pass through the heart of the region whose products
reach market through the ports of the Pacific.
All of this vast interior region is now opened
to Tacoma, and trade relations are rapidly being
established. In addition to this, the Portland
branch gives access to the rich section lying south
of the city. In addition to this line the merchants
of Tacoma have direct connection by steamer with
the terminus of the Canadian Pacific, and thus
have another through route to the east. Lines
now under construction north will connect Tacoma
with the Canadian Pacific by rail. The extension
to a Puget sound harbor of the Southern Pacific
railroad, now as far north as Portland, has been
practically announced by gentlemen connected
with that company, and that the Union Pacific
will also seek a Puget sound terminus is quite certain.
Both of these roads, and in fact, any road
building north from the Columbia, west of the
Cascades, will undoubtedly come to Tacoma. The
Tacoma Southern is being built south from Crocker,
on the Northern Pacific, into a body of timber
fifteen miles distant. This is looked upon as a
link in a line to the Columbia. The Tacoma,
Olympia &amp; Chehalis Valley R. R. Co. has been
incorporated, to build a line from Gray’s harbor
up the Chehalis valley and across the Cascade
mountains to the Columbia, with a branch running
north to Tacoma. This would give this city
another line to the Inland Empire, as well as a line
to Gray’s harbor and the fertile Chehalis valley.</p>

<h2>SWITCHBACK ON THE NORTHERN PACIFIC RAILROAD.</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-d.jpg" width="75" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Desiring to open the Northern Pacific to travel
and traffic a year earlier than was possible
if they waited for the completion of the
huge tunnel through the Cascades, a great passage
blasted through the mountains ninety-eight hundred
and fifty feet in length, the officers decided to
construct a line over the summit on the “switchback”
principle, at a cost of $300,000.00. It was
completed early in the summer of 1887, having
seven miles of track and an average grade of nearly
three hundred feet to the mile. Huge decapod
(ten drive wheels) locomotives were built for this
service, the most powerful ever constructed. Two
decapods are used, one at each end of the short
train. The bottom line of the diagram represents
the main track at the mouth of the tunnel. The
train moves ahead until it passes the switch S,
and then moves backward and upward until it
passes the next switch, thus alternating until the
summit is gained, when it descends on the opposite
side in the same manner. The general principle
of the “switchback” is clearly shown in the
following diagram:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">

</div>

<p>Since the completion of the tunnel, early in the
summer of 1888, the switchback has not been used
for general traffic. The scenery of the mountains
is enchanting, the view from the line of the switchback
being grand beyond description.</p>

<h2>BEAUTIFUL HOMES OF TACOMA.</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-b.jpg" width="75" height="85" alt="" />

<p class="dropcap">Beautiful and costly residences, occupying
commanding sites and standing in the midst
of green lawns ornamented with a profusion
of flowers and shrubs, are one of the noticeable
features of Tacoma, and they speak of the culture
and refinement, as well as the material prosperity
of the people. In the topography of the ground
upon which the city is situated, an excellent opportunity
is offered for elegant and sightly residences.
Rising in a gradual ascent from the business
portion, the residence area offers an unbroken
view across the bay and valley to the mountains,
so that the windows of nearly every house
in the city command a view of the snow-crowned
monarch of the Cascades, set in a landscape of
wonderful beauty. Many extremely elegant and
costly residences have been erected. Among these
are the homes of Gen. J. W. Sprague, J. M. Buckley,
Esq., J. S. Baker, Esq., Isaac W. Anderson,
Esq., Geo. E. Atkinson, Esq., A. C. Smith, Esq.,
Allen C. Mason, Esq., and E. Pierce, Esq., engravings
of which are given on the opposite and succeeding
pages. For so young a city, and one
whose energies have been taxed to the utmost to
provide facilities for its expanding business, the
number of beautiful homes is remarkable, and indicates
that its people recognize the advantages
nature has given them to build up here one of the
most beautiful cities on the continent. They are
accomplishing this very rapidly.</p>

<h2>HOPS OF THE PUYALLUP VALLEY.</h2>

<div>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Hops are the leading agricultural product of the
Puget sound region, and hop ranches are
nearly all directly tributary to Tacoma. Puyallup
valley, whose fame as a hop producing section
has encircled the world, lies just east of the
city, the line of the Northern Pacific passing directly
through it. Upwards of three thousand
acres are now in vine, which yielded twenty thousand
bales in 1887, and twenty-five thousand in
1888, when an average of one thousand seven hundred
pounds per acre of both old and young vines
was secured. The superior quality of the cones,
the freedom from pests and disease, the enormous
yield and the rapid growth of young vines, combine
to render this region foremost in the world in
its adaptability to this special crop. Not only does
the Puyallup valley produce hops, but other crops
as well. Several thriving villages and numerous
highly cultivated farms attest the prosperity of its
people, as well as giving evidence of the valuable
nature of the agricultural area immediately tributary
to Tacoma. Puyallup hops are in demand in
Japan, Europe and the eastern states of America,
because of their superior quality and appearance.
In the picking season the hop fields are the scene
of great industry, and the numerous camps of
pickers present a pleasing picture as the train passes
up the valley.</p>

<h2>HISTORY OF TACOMA REAL ESTATE.</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-a.jpg" width="75" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">A common expression of visitors is that “real
estate is too high,” and many decline to invest
in property for that reason, only to repent
not many months later when values have advanced
on all classes of property. Six years ago
the same opinion was expressed, and the prediction
was made that property values would take a
tumble, and that the “boom” would collapse.
Even in the “hard times” of 1884-5 these predictions
were not realized. Values were fully sustained,
and as soon as the nation began to recover
from its financial depression, Tacoma real estate
again started upward, and is still steadily advancing.
The lot that was “too high” at $50 in 1883,
and again declared “too high” at $200 in 1886, is
now worth $500. The same opportunities exist to-day
to buy lots at $50 and $100 that will in a few
years be worth ten times their present value.
Property in residence sections is a safe investment.
The Sawyer addition lies near the center of the
residence portion and contains one hundred and
ninety lots, sixty-five of which are sold. Water is
on the ground and street cars are within two blocks,
while the Methodist university will be erected within
one block. Oakland addition lies in the southwestern
portion of the city overlooking the natural
park, and is most desirable residence property.
Traver’s addition is but one-half mile from the
city limits, easy of access by good roads, and near
the present terminus of the steam motor line.
This is most desirable property, and is selling at
$100 per lot on easy terms. White &amp; Ouimette’s
addition lies one and one-half miles from the limits,
near the line of Hart’s railroad, and lots are
sold at $50 each on the installment plan. Five
years from now those who fail to invest in this
class of residence property will be regretting it as
keenly as do those now who made the same mistake
about $50 and $100 lots five years ago. The
increase in real estate values is best shown by the
city assessment roll. In 1880 it was but $517,927;
in 1886, $4,092,119; and in two years has increased
to a total of $6,555,433. There has been a general
advance in all classes of property, and no matter
how high it has ever seemed to be, it is higher now
and will be still higher a year hence.</p>

<h2>COMMERCIAL ADVANTAGES OF TACOMA.</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-m.jpg" width="85" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Many advantages are possessed by Tacoma
which can not fail to result in building up
here a large commercial city. A very large
wholesale business is already established in many
important lines of trade, and some of the largest
and most complete retail stores to be found on the
Pacific coast are located here. As an index of the
condition of trade here the banking statistics are
valuable. There are four national banks, one
large private bank and a savings bank. The combined
capital stock of these institutions is $630,000.
The four national banks have $1,930,000 deposits,
$1,892,000 discounts and $120,000 surplus and undivided
profits. Such a showing of banking business
indicates a volume of trade of large proportions,
and as deposits have nearly doubled during
the past year, the growth of trade is certainly remarkable.
Tacoma’s position as the terminus of
a great overland railway, as well as the terminal
port on Puget sound for all local and ocean steamer
lines, is one that assures it an enormous jobbing
trade throughout the entire northwest. As a port
of shipment for the coal, lumber, grain, iron, minerals
and manufactured and agricultural products
of an immense region, it must necessarily be the
chief commercial point of the same section, and
this is the cause of the marvelous increase in business
during the first year after the completion of
the railroad across the mountains. Foreign commerce
already seeks this port for entrance into the
United States. The sails of a clipper ship from
China and Japan is a common sight in the harbor,
and will be more frequent in the future. A line of
steamers connecting the Northern Pacific with the
ports of China, Japan, Australia and New Zealand
is one of the certainties of a not distant future.
Having the advantage over San Francisco
of a much shorter route to China, Tacoma, as the
chief port on Puget sound, can not fail to be a formidable
rival to that city for the Oriental trade.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Between the harbor of Tacoma as it was in
1880 and as it is to-day there is as strong a
contrast as between a wilderness and a walled
city, and yet the harbor of the city of ten years
hence will present a still stronger contrast. Along
the western shore of Commencement bay run the
numerous tracks of the Northern Pacific, along
which have been erected most costly wharfs, warehouses,
docks, coal bunkers and numerous other
commercial facilities. Saw mills have multiplied
and other factories are being located. On the opposite
page is given an engraving of a portion of
the water front, showing coal bunkers, saw mill
and other features. Between the row of piles on
the right of the foreground and the city, which
lies to the left, is the channel of Puyallup river,
not accessible to vessels at low tide. Here most
extensive improvements have been planned, consisting
of dredging the channel and constructing
deep water docks along both sides of it. An immense
area of mud flats lies back of the row of
piling mentioned, which will be cut off from water
by this work, and rendered available for commercial
purposes. Here will be located factories, warehouses
and wholesale stores of the future city. A
mammoth saw mill is already being constructed
on the flats. By this means large additions will
be made to the water front, already six miles in
length, and the docks and channel will pierce the
heart of the city. Objection has sometimes been
made to the fact that the harbor is so deep that
vessels can not anchor near the docks. There is
good holding ground farther out in the bay, and
the docking facilities being provided will remove
any possible objection. In its harbor Tacoma has
all that is required by the largest city in the world.</p>

<h2>GREEN RIVER HOT SPRINGS.</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">One of the favorite summer resorts of the
northwest is situated on the line of the
Northern Pacific, sixty-one miles east of
Tacoma, in the Cascade mountains. This is the
celebrated Green River Hot Springs, five in number,
with a temperature varying from 118° to 122°
Fahrenheit, which were discovered four years ago.
A comfortable hotel, with accommodations for a
large number of people, and ten cottages have already
been erected. Green river is the most beautiful
mountain stream in the west, and teems with
trout and salmon. It derives its name from the
green hue of its clear, transparent waters, brilliant
in the sunlight and dark green in the shade. The
mountains are full of deer, bear, mountain sheep,
grouse and other game. No shooting is permitted
within two hundred and fifty yards of the hotel,
but the hunter and angler has not far to go to find
employment for his rod and gun. Tourists will
find this place the most delightful for a few days’
rest in the whole extent of their journey through
the west. This has been recognized by hundreds,
who have availed themselves of the opportunity to
enjoy the pleasure and sport here afforded. Invalids,
especially, find in the medicinal qualities of
the water, the pure, bracing atmosphere of the
mountains, the wholesome food, and the sense of
rest and freedom from care, just the conditions
necessary for their restoration to health. The
waters are a specific for rheumatism, catarrh, kidney
troubles, skin and blood diseases, etc., and
their virtue is attested by hundreds who have been
benefited by them. A post office and telegraph
station have been established at the hotel, and the
sojourner there need not feel that he is completely
isolated from the world, while daily trains pass the
hotel to carry him away in case of urgent need.
Persons desirous of securing accommodations in
advance of arrival should address, by mail or telegraph,
I. G. McCain &amp; Co., Hot Springs, W. T.</p>

<h2>SCENERY OF PUGET SOUND.</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-f.jpg" width="75" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">From a picturesque standpoint, Puget sound
possesses attractions of a high order. Its
shores, which, in the main, come down in
bluffy steeps to the very margin of the waters, are
lined with verdant firs. Here and there the rolling
hills are broken, where some stream pours
down from the mountains and flows through a fertile
valley, covered with a rank growth of forests
of cedar, fir, maple, alder, cottonwood and creeping
vines, save where the hand of man has cleared
a way for the plow, and converted the forest wild
into green meadows and fields of grain. Back
from the shores, the forests rise in successive terraces
as they climb the mountain sides, and soften
their rugged outlines clear to their summits, save
where here and there some giant snow peak thrusts
its hoary head far above the green mantle of the
mountains, and challenges the traveler’s eye from
whatever direction he may be approaching. On a
clear, warm, bracing day in early summer time,
the traveler down the sound has almost constantly
in view one of these snowy summits. Mount Tacoma
to the southeast, Mount Baker to the northeast,
and the long, serrated ridge of the Olympic
range to the west, all hold their snowy crowns aloft
for his inspection. The calm, deep waters of the
sound, like the bosom of a mountain tarn, reflect
the sun’s rays by day, and by night glisten under
the shimmering light of the moon. A journey
down its winding channels, through its narrow
passages, among its hundreds of islands, past its
cities, towns and busy mills, the eye constantly
greeted by new and ever-changing landscapes of
beauty, is one never to be forgotten by him who
takes it when a clear sky and full moon combine
to reveal its beauties, both day and night. Tacoma’s
location renders it the best headquarters for
tourists while enjoying the beauties of the sound.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
